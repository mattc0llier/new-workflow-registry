The workflow `World` is an interface that abstracts how workflows and steps communicate with the outside world, letting you build custom adapters and reuse them across different environments, infrastructure, and hosting providers.

## Choosing a World implementation

* By default, Workflow uses the [Local world](/docs/deploying/world/local-world) for easy local development.
* When deployed on Vercel, Workflow switches to the [Vercel world](/docs/deploying/world/vercel-world).

If you want to use a different World implementation, set the `WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD` environment variable to your desired World package's NPM name:

```bash
export WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=@my-namespace/my-npm-package
export MY_WORLD_CONFIG=... # implementation-specific configuration
```

## Built-in Worlds

Workflow DevKit provides two built-in world implementations:

- [Local World](/docs/deploying/world/local-world) - Filesystem-based for local development
- [Vercel World](/docs/deploying/world/vercel-world) - Production-ready for Vercel deployments

## Community Worlds

> These worlds are maintained by the community and tested in CI. See the [worlds-manifest.json](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/blob/main/worlds-manifest.json) for configuration details.

- [Turso](https://github.com/mizzle-dev/workflow-worlds/tree/main/packages/turso) (`@workflow-worlds/turso`) - Turso/libSQL World for embedded or remote SQLite databases
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/mizzle-dev/workflow-worlds/tree/main/packages/mongodb) (`@workflow-worlds/mongodb`) - MongoDB World using native driver
- [Redis](https://github.com/mizzle-dev/workflow-worlds/tree/main/packages/redis) (`@workflow-worlds/redis`) - Redis World using BullMQ for queues, Redis Streams for output

### Other Community Worlds
