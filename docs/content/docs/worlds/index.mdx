# Workflow Worlds Ecosystem

The Workflow `World` is an interface that abstracts how workflows and steps communicate with the outside world. This page shows the compatibility status and performance of all available World implementations.

<WorldsDashboardServer />

## What is a World?

A World implementation handles:
- **Workflow Storage**: Persisting workflow state and event logs
- **Step Execution**: Managing step function invocations
- **Message Passing**: Communication between workflow orchestrator and step functions

## Choosing a World

| Use Case | Recommended World |
|----------|------------------|
| Local development | Local World |
| Vercel deployment | Vercel World |
| Self-hosted with PostgreSQL | Postgres World |
| Edge/embedded databases | Turso World |
| High-throughput queues | Redis World |

## Contributing a World

Want to build your own World implementation? Check out the [World interface documentation](/docs/deploying/world) and the [reference implementations](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/tree/main/packages) for guidance.

Community worlds are tested in CI against our E2E test suite. To add your world to this dashboard:

1. Implement the World interface
2. Publish to npm
3. Open a PR to add your world to `worlds-manifest.json`
