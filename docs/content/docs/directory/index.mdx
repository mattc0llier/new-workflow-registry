# Workflow Directory

The Workflow Directory is a registry of reusable steps and workflows that you can use in your projects. Browse community-contributed steps, learn how to install and use them, and contribute your own.

## Key Features

- **Discover Steps**: Browse available steps for common tasks
- **Easy Installation**: Simple package-based installation
- **MCP Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Model Context Protocol servers
- **Community Contributions**: Share your steps with the community
